## Quick Start

Import the package:

```dart
import 'package:flexiblebox/flexiblebox_flutter.dart';
import 'package:flexiblebox/flexiblebox_extensions.dart'; // For convenient extension methods
```

Create a simple flex layout:

```dart
FlexBox(
  direction: FlexDirection.row,
  rowGap: 8.0.spacing,
  children: [
    FlexItem(
      flexGrow: 1.0,
      child: Container(
        color: Colors.red,
        height: 100,
        child: Center(child: Text('Flexible Item')),
      ),
    ),
    FlexItem(
      width: 100.0.size,
      child: Container(
        color: Colors.blue,
        height: 100,
        child: Center(child: Text('Fixed Width')),
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

## Why FlexibleBox?

FlexibleBox provides a different approach to layout compared to Flutter's
built-in widgets, offering several advantages for complex, responsive layouts:

### CSS Flexbox Specification Compliance

FlexibleBox implements the complete CSS Flexbox specification, providing
familiar layout behavior for developers coming from web development. This
includes:

- **True flex-basis calculation**: Proper handling of flex grow/shrink with
  min/max constraints
- **Multi-line wrapping**: Full control over line breaking and line alignment
- **Advanced spacing**: Separate row and column gaps with space-between,
  space-around, and space-evenly

### Different Layout Philosophy

FlexibleBox uses a fundamentally different layout approach compared to Flutter's
native constraint-based system:

#### Flutter's Layout System (BoxConstraints)

Flutter uses a **"constraints go down, sizes go up"** protocol:

1. Parent passes `BoxConstraints` (min/max width and height) to children
2. Each child decides its size within those constraints
3. Children return their chosen size to the parent
4. Parent uses returned sizes to position children

This is a **single-pass, local decision** system where:

- Each widget only knows about constraints from its immediate parent
- Children make sizing decisions independently
- Parent positions children after all sizes are known
- No child can know the final sizes of its siblings

**Example with Flutter's Row:**

```dart
Row(
  children: [
    Expanded(child: Container()), // Gets remaining space
    Container(width: 100),         // Fixed 100px
  ],
)
```

The `Expanded` child doesn't know the other child's size during layout -
Flutter's `Row` manages the space distribution after collecting all sizes.

#### FlexibleBox's Layout System

FlexibleBox implements a **multi-pass CSS Flexbox algorithm**:

1. **First Pass - Measurement**: Layout all children with loose constraints to
   determine their intrinsic/preferred sizes (flex-basis)
2. **Second Pass - Flex Resolution**: Calculate available space and distribute
   it among flex items using flex-grow and flex-shrink factors, respecting
   min/max constraints
3. **Third Pass - Cross-Axis Sizing**: Determine cross-axis sizes based on
   alignment and stretch behavior
4. **Fourth Pass - Positioning**: Place all children at their final positions
   with knowledge of all sizes and spacing

This is a **multi-pass, global optimization** system where:

- The container knows all children's sizes before making final decisions
- Space is distributed according to flex factors after measuring all children
- Children can be sized relative to viewport, content, or sibling dimensions
- Proper handling of complex scenarios with multiple constraints
- **Children receive tight constraints during layout**: Because the parent has
  already calculated the exact size each child should be, it passes tight
  constraints (min == max) to children during the final layout pass. This is
  different from Flutter's typical loose constraints and ensures precise control
  over final dimensions.
- **Native 2D scrolling**: FlexibleBox supports simultaneous horizontal and
  vertical scrolling without nested scroll views. The included `Scrollbars`
  widget provides unified visual feedback for both scroll directions.

**Example with FlexibleBox:**

```dart
FlexBox(
  direction: FlexDirection.row,
  children: [
    FlexItem(
      flexGrow: 1,
      minWidth: 100.size,
      child: Container(),
    ),
    FlexItem(
      width: 200.size,
      flexShrink: 2,
      child: Container(),
    ),
  ],
)
```

FlexibleBox measures both children first, calculates total space needed (300px),
then distributes available space or shrinkage proportionally according to flex
factors while respecting the minWidth constraint - just like CSS Flexbox.

#### Key Technical Differences

| Aspect                 | Flutter (Row/Column)                                 | FlexibleBox                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Layout passes**      | Single pass                                          | Multi-pass (measure → flex → align → position)                |
| **Size constraints**   | BoxConstraints (min/max)                             | SizeUnit (fixed, viewport-relative, content-based)            |
| **Flex algorithm**     | Simplified flex with MainAxisSize/CrossAxisAlignment | Full CSS Flexbox specification                                |
| **Space distribution** | Basic Expanded/Flexible widgets                      | Precise flex-grow/flex-shrink with proper constraint handling |
| **Sibling awareness**  | No knowledge of sibling sizes                        | Full knowledge of all children after measurement              |
| **Child constraints**  | Typically loose constraints                          | Tight constraints (min == max) during final layout            |
| **Wrapping**           | No native support in Row/Column                      | Multi-line with line alignment (align-content)                |
| **2D Scrolling**       | Requires nested scroll views                         | Native support with unified scrollbars                        |
| **Overflow**           | Handled by parent constraints                        | Explicit overflow modes with viewport positioning             |

This multi-pass approach allows FlexibleBox to handle scenarios that are
difficult or impossible with Flutter's single-pass system, such as distributing
space proportionally among items with complex size constraints, or positioning
elements relative to total content size.

#### Advanced Features Comparison

FlexibleBox provides sophisticated sizing, positioning, spacing, and alignment
options that go far beyond Flutter's native capabilities:

| Feature Category        | Flutter (Row/Column/Stack)                                                                                                       | FlexibleBox                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sizing Options**      | • Fixed sizes (width/height)<br>• BoxConstraints (min/max)<br>• Expanded/Flexible                                                | • Fixed sizes (SizeUnit.fixed)<br>• Viewport-relative (0.5.relativeSize for 50%)<br>• Content-relative sizing<br>• Min/max per item<br>• Flex grow/shrink with proper constraint handling                      |

| **Spacing**             | • MainAxisAlignment (limited distribution)<br>• SizedBox for gaps<br>• No native gap support                                     | • Row and column gaps (native)<br>• space-between (even distribution)<br>• space-around (half space at edges)<br>• space-evenly (equal space everywhere)<br>• Flexible padding with viewport units             |
| **Alignment**           | • MainAxisAlignment (5 options)<br>• CrossAxisAlignment (5 options)<br>• No multi-line alignment<br>• No align-content           | • justifyContent (main-axis, 7 options)<br>• alignItems (cross-axis, 6 options)<br>• alignSelf (per-item override)<br>• alignContent (multi-line, 7 options)<br>• Stretch alignment<br>• Full CSS Flexbox spec |
| **Additional Features** | • Fixed paint order (tree order)<br>• No layout data access<br>• Hit testing limited to parent bounds                            | • paintOrder (explicit z-ordering)<br>• Layout data builders (scroll, overflow, viewport info)<br>• Hit testing respects actual painted bounds<br>• Overflow bounds detection                                  |

**Key Advantages:**

- **Viewport-Relative Sizing**: Use `0.5.relativeSize` or `0.3.relativeSize` to
  size elements relative to the viewport (50% or 30%), eliminating the need for
  `LayoutBuilder` and `MediaQuery` boilerplate
- **True Sticky Positioning**: Elements that scroll normally until reaching an
  edge, then stick (not possible with Row/Column, requires complex Sliver setup
  in Flutter)
- **Space Distribution Algorithms**: Proper `space-between`, `space-around`, and
  `space-evenly` that work with wrapping layouts (Flutter's MainAxisAlignment is
  limited)
- **Per-Item Constraints**: Each FlexItem can have its own min/max width/height
  that integrates with the flex algorithm (Flutter requires manual constraint
  management)
- **Multi-Line Alignment**: Control how wrapped lines distribute within the
  container with `alignContent` (no equivalent in Flutter's Wrap)
- **Paint Order Control**: Override natural paint order for proper shadow and
  overlay rendering (impossible in Flutter without restructuring the widget
  tree)
- **Layout-Aware Building**: Access scroll position, overflow bounds, and
  viewport data to build dynamic, responsive UI (limited to basic constraints in
  Flutter's LayoutBuilder)

### Flutter Layout Limitations

Flutter's constraint-based system has several inherent limitations that
FlexibleBox addresses:

#### 1. No Sibling Size Awareness

In Flutter's single-pass system, children cannot know their siblings' sizes
during layout. This makes certain layouts challenging:

**Problem:**

```dart
// Trying to make items equal to the tallest item
Column(
  children: [
    Container(height: 100), // Unknown to siblings
    Container(height: 150), // Unknown to siblings
    Container(height: 120), // Unknown to siblings
  ],
)
```

You need workarounds like `IntrinsicHeight` or manual state management.

**FlexibleBox Solution:**

```dart
FlexBox(
  direction: FlexDirection.column,
  alignItems: BoxAlignmentGeometry.stretch, // All items match tallest
  children: [
    FlexItem(child: Container()),
    FlexItem(child: Container()),
    FlexItem(child: Container()),
  ],
)
```

FlexibleBox knows all children's sizes after measurement and can apply stretch
alignment.

#### 2. Complex Flex Distribution

Flutter's `Expanded` and `Flexible` widgets handle basic flex scenarios, but
struggle with complex constraints:

**Problem:**

```dart
Row(
  children: [
    Flexible(
      flex: 2,
      child: Container(
        constraints: BoxConstraints(minWidth: 200, maxWidth: 300),
        // Flutter may not respect these constraints optimally
      ),
    ),
    Flexible(flex: 1, child: Container()),
  ],
)
```

Flutter's flex resolution doesn't follow CSS Flexbox rules precisely when
constraints conflict.

**FlexibleBox Solution:**

```dart
FlexBox(
  direction: FlexDirection.row,
  children: [
    FlexItem(
      flexGrow: 2,
      flexShrink: 2,
      minWidth: 200.size,
      maxWidth: 300.size,
      child: Container(),
    ),
    FlexItem(flexGrow: 1, flexShrink: 1, child: Container()),
  ],
)
```

FlexibleBox implements the full CSS Flexbox algorithm with proper constraint
handling and shrink factor calculations.

#### 3. Pointer Events Outside Parent Bounds

This is a critical limitation: **Flutter does not deliver pointer events (taps,
drags, hovers) to child widgets that are positioned outside their parent's paint
bounds.**

**Problem with Flutter's Stack:**

```dart
Container(
  width: 200,
  height: 200,
  color: Colors.blue,
  child: Stack(
    clipBehavior: Clip.none, // Allows visual overflow
    children: [
      Positioned(
        left: -50, // 50px outside parent bounds
        top: 100,
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => print('Clicked!'),
          child: Text('Button'),
        ),
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

The button is visible (with `Clip.none`), but **the left 50px cannot be
clicked** because it's outside the parent's 200px width. Flutter's hit testing
only considers the parent's bounds, not the child's actual painted area.

**FlexibleBox Solution:**

```dart
Container(
  width: 200,
  height: 200,
  child: FlexBox(
    clipContent: false, // Allows visual and interactive overflow
    children: [
      AbsoluteItem(
        left: (-50).position, // 50px outside parent bounds
        top: 100.position,
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => print('Clicked!'),
          child: Text('Button'),
        ),
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

**FlexibleBox respects the child's actual painted bounds for hit testing**,
meaning:

- If `clipContent: false`, the entire button (including the part outside parent
  bounds) is clickable
- If `clipContent: true`, hit testing is clipped to parent bounds (like
  Flutter's default)
- You have explicit control over both visual clipping and interaction clipping

**Important:** Standard Flutter widgets will block pointer events outside their
bounds, even when wrapping FlexibleBox. To preserve FlexibleBox's extended hit
testing behavior, avoid wrapping it with non-FlexibleBox widgets.

**This breaks extended hit testing:**

```dart
Container(
  // this Container blocks pointer events outside its bounds,
  // so the left 50px of the button will not be clickable
  width: 200,
  height: 200,
  color: Colors.grey,
  child: FlexBox(
    clipContent: false,
    children: [
      AbsoluteItem(
        left: (-50).position, // 50px outside Container bounds
        top: 100.position,
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => print('Clicked!'),
          child: Text('Button'),
        ),
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

The Container's 200×200 bounds will block pointer events to the left 50px of the
button, even though FlexBox allows the button to render outside.

**This preserves extended hit testing:**

```dart
Container(
  // this Container blocks pointer events outside its bounds,
  width: 200,
  height: 200,
  color: Colors.grey,
  child: Stack(
    // Stack is 200x200, and also blocks pointer events outside its bounds,
    // but Stack shrinks the FlexBox so it fits within Container,
    // making it able to receive pointer events outside 200x200 area
    // although it is now a little bit smaller visually
    children: [
      Positioned(
        top: 0,
        left: 50,
        right: 0,
        bottom: 0,
        child: FlexBox(
          clipContent: false,
          children: [
            AbsoluteItem(
              left: (-50).position, 
              top: 100.position,
              child: ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: () => print('Clicked!'),
                child: Text('Button'),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

By using AbsoluteItem for the background instead of wrapping FlexBox with
Container, pointer events work correctly for elements outside the 200×200 area.

This is crucial for:

- Dropdown menus that extend beyond their trigger button
- Tooltips that overflow their parent container
- Floating action buttons positioned at container edges
- Context menus and popovers
- Any UI where interactive elements need to overflow their layout bounds

#### 4. Viewport-Relative Sizing

Flutter's constraints are always relative to the immediate parent, making
viewport-relative sizing cumbersome:

**Problem:**

```dart
// Need LayoutBuilder and manual calculations
LayoutBuilder(
  builder: (context, constraints) {
    final screenWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
    return Container(
      width: screenWidth * 0.5, // 50% of screen width
      child: Text('Half screen width'),
    );
  },
)
```

**Note:** Using `LayoutBuilder` prevents Flutter from computing intrinsic sizes
for this widget subtree. Widgets like `IntrinsicWidth`, `IntrinsicHeight`, or
any parent that queries child intrinsic dimensions will not work correctly with
`LayoutBuilder` in the path, because builders cannot provide intrinsic
measurements without actual constraints.

**FlexibleBox Solution:**

```dart
FlexBox(
  children: [
    FlexItem(
      width: 0.5.relativeSize, // 50% of viewport directly
      child: Text('Half screen width'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

FlexibleBox has built-in viewport awareness with no extra widgets needed.

#### 5. Two-Dimensional Scrolling

Flutter's scrolling widgets (`SingleChildScrollView`, `ListView`,
`CustomScrollView`) only support single-axis scrolling. For 2D scrolling, you
must nest scroll views, which has several issues:

**Problem with Nested ScrollViews:**

```dart
// Nested scrolling - problematic
SingleChildScrollView(
  scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
  child: SingleChildScrollView(
    scrollDirection: Axis.vertical,
    child: Container(
      width: 2000,
      height: 2000,
      // Large content
    ),
  ),
)
```

Issues with this approach:

- Ambiguous gesture handling (which scroll view captures the drag?)
- No unified scrollbar for both directions
- Difficult to coordinate scroll positions
- Cannot use diagonal drag gestures effectively

**FlexibleBox Solution:**

```dart
SizedBox(
  width: 400,
  height: 300,
  child: Scrollbars(
    // Unified scrollbar widget supporting both directions
    child: FlexBox(
      horizontalOverflow: LayoutOverflow.hidden, // Enable horizontal scroll with clipping
      verticalOverflow: LayoutOverflow.hidden,   // Enable vertical scroll with clipping
      children: [
        FlexItem(
          width: 2000.size,  // Wide content
          height: 2000.size, // Tall content
          child: YourLargeWidget(),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ),
)
```

**Advantages:**

- **Single scroll context**: No nested scroll views, cleaner gesture handling
- **Diagonal scrolling**: Users can drag diagonally to scroll in both directions
  simultaneously
- **Unified scrollbars**: The `Scrollbars` widget shows both horizontal and
  vertical scrollbars automatically based on overflow
- **Coordinated scrolling**: Both axes share the same scroll context and can be
  controlled programmatically together

**Scrollbars Widget Features:**

- Automatically shows/hides based on content overflow
- Supports both horizontal and vertical scrolling in the same widget
- Customizable appearance (thumb color, thickness, margins)
- Interactive dragging on scrollbar thumbs
- Smooth fade in/out animations
- Works seamlessly with touch, mouse, and trackpad input

**Important Note on Child Building:**

Unlike Flutter's `ListView`, `GridView`, or other lazy-loading scrolling
widgets, **FlexibleBox builds all children upfront**, even those that are
outside the visible viewport. When `clipContent: true`, children outside the
viewport are not painted (not visible), but they are still built and exist in
the widget tree.

This is a fundamental difference in approach:

- **Flutter's ListView**: Builds children lazily as they scroll into view
  (optimized for many items)
- **FlexibleBox**: Builds all children immediately (optimized for complex
  layouts with known items)

**Implications:**

- ✅ **Best for**: Known, finite number of items with complex flex layouts
- ✅ **Best for**: Content where all items need to participate in flex
  calculations
- ⚠️ **Not ideal for**: Very long lists with hundreds or thousands of items
- ⚠️ **Not ideal for**: Infinite scrolling scenarios where lazy loading is
  essential

If you have a large number of items (e.g., 100+), consider using Flutter's
`ListView` or `GridView` instead, or implement custom lazy loading on top of
FlexibleBox.

This makes FlexibleBox ideal for:

- Data tables or grids with a reasonable number of rows/columns
- Image galleries with a known set of images
- Maps or canvas-like interfaces with fixed content
- Spreadsheet-style layouts with defined dimensions
- Dashboard layouts with multiple panels
- Any content that naturally overflows in both dimensions but has a finite,
  known size

#### 6. Wrap Widget Limitations

Flutter's `Wrap` widget provides basic wrapping functionality, but lacks many
flexbox features:

**Limitations of Flutter's Wrap:**

1. **No Flex Growing/Shrinking**: Items in `Wrap` cannot grow or shrink to fill
   space

   ```dart
   Wrap(
     children: [
       Container(width: 100, child: Text('Fixed')),
       Container(width: 150, child: Text('Also Fixed')),
       // No equivalent to flex-grow or flex-shrink
     ],
   )
   ```

2. **No Main-Axis Alignment Per Line**: `Wrap` has `alignment` but it's global,
   not per-line

   ```dart
   Wrap(
     alignment: WrapAlignment.spaceBetween, // Applied uniformly
     children: [/* items */],
   )
   ```

   You cannot have different alignment for different lines or `space-between`
   that respects line breaks.

3. **No Cross-Axis Line Alignment**: No equivalent to CSS Flexbox's
   `align-content`

   ```dart
   Wrap(
     runAlignment: WrapAlignment.start, // Limited line alignment
     // No space-between, space-around, space-evenly for lines
   )
   ```

4. **No Size Constraints on Items**: Cannot set min/max width/height per item
   within the wrap

   ```dart
   Wrap(
     children: [
       Container(
         constraints: BoxConstraints(minWidth: 100, maxWidth: 200),
         // Works, but doesn't interact with wrap algorithm
       ),
     ],
   )
   ```

**FlexibleBox Solution:**

```dart
FlexBox(
  direction: FlexDirection.row,
  wrap: FlexWrap.wrap,
  justifyContent: BoxAlignmentBase.spaceBetween, // Per-line space distribution
  alignContent: BoxAlignmentContent.spaceEvenly, // Line distribution
  alignItems: BoxAlignmentGeometry.stretch,      // Stretch alignment
  rowGap: 8.spacing,
  columnGap: 8.spacing,
  children: [
    FlexItem(
      flexGrow: 1,           // Grows to fill space
      flexShrink: 1,         // Shrinks when constrained
      minWidth: 100.size,    // Minimum width constraint
      maxWidth: 300.size,    // Maximum width constraint
      child: Text('Flexible'),
    ),
    FlexItem(
      flexGrow: 2,           // Grows twice as fast
      minWidth: 150.size,
      child: Text('More flexible'),
    ),
    FlexItem(
      width: 120.size,       // Fixed width
      child: Text('Fixed'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

**Example: Responsive Tag List**

With `Wrap`, tags are fixed size:

```dart
Wrap(
  spacing: 8,
  children: [
    Chip(label: Text('Flutter')),
    Chip(label: Text('Dart')),
    Chip(label: Text('Mobile Development')),
  ],
)
```

With FlexibleBox, tags can grow to fill lines efficiently:

```dart
FlexBox(
  direction: FlexDirection.row,
  wrap: FlexWrap.wrap,
  justifyContent: BoxAlignmentBase.spaceBetween,
  rowGap: 8.spacing,
  columnGap: 8.spacing,
  children: [
    FlexItem(
      flexGrow: 1,
      minWidth: 80.size,
      child: Chip(label: Text('Flutter')),
    ),
    FlexItem(
      flexGrow: 1,
      minWidth: 80.size,
      child: Chip(label: Text('Dart')),
    ),
    FlexItem(
      flexGrow: 1,
      minWidth: 80.size,
      child: Chip(label: Text('Mobile Development')),
    ),
  ],
)
```

The FlexibleBox version ensures tags grow proportionally to fill each line while
respecting minimum sizes, creating a more polished responsive layout.

#### 7. No Control Over Paint Order

Flutter paints children in the order they appear in the widget tree, which can
cause visual issues when children overlap:

**Problem with Flutter:**

```dart
Stack(
  children: [
    Positioned(
      left: 50,
      top: 50,
      child: Container(
        width: 100,
        height: 100,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: Colors.red,
          boxShadow: [
            BoxShadow(
              color: Colors.black45,
              blurRadius: 20,
              spreadRadius: 5,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
    Positioned(
      left: 100,
      top: 100,
      child: Container(
        width: 100,
        height: 100,
        color: Colors.blue,
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, the red container has a shadow. The shadow will paint **above**
the previous sibling (nothing in this case) but will paint **below** the blue
container (next sibling) due to Flutter's natural paint order. This creates an
inconsistent visual appearance where the shadow is partially cut off.

**FlexibleBox Solution:**

```dart
FlexBox(
  children: [
    AbsoluteItem(
      left: 50.position,
      top: 50.position,
      paintOrder: 2, // Paint on top
      child: Container(
        width: 100,
        height: 100,
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: Colors.red,
          boxShadow: [
            BoxShadow(
              color: Colors.black45,
              blurRadius: 20,
              spreadRadius: 5,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
    AbsoluteItem(
      left: 100.position,
      top: 100.position,
      paintOrder: 1, // Paint below
      child: Container(
        width: 100,
        height: 100,
        color: Colors.blue,
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

The `paintOrder` property allows explicit control over the drawing order:

- **Optional property**: If not set, items follow Flutter's natural paint order
  (tree order)
- **Lower values paint first** (appear behind)
- **Higher values paint later** (appear in front)
- Items with the same `paintOrder` value use tree order as a tiebreaker
- This ensures shadows and overlapping elements render correctly regardless of
  tree position

**Use Cases:**

- Ensuring shadows always render above or below specific elements
- Creating layered UI with explicit z-order control
- Overlapping cards or panels with consistent stacking
- Tooltips and popovers that should always appear on top

#### 8. Sticky Positioning Not Natively Supported

Flutter has no built-in support for sticky positioning (elements that behave
like relative positioning until scrolling, then become fixed within their
container).

**Note:** Flutter does provide sticky-like behavior through `SliverAppBar` and
`SliverPersistentHeader` within `CustomScrollView`, but this requires using the
sliver architecture which is complex and limited to specific scrolling contexts.
It's not a general-purpose sticky positioning solution like CSS's
`position: sticky`.

**FlexibleBox Solution:**

```dart
FlexBox(
  direction: FlexDirection.column,
  verticalOverflow: LayoutOverflow.scroll,
  children: [
    FlexItem(
      top: 0.position,    // Stick to the top edge
      child: Container(
        height: 50,
        color: Colors.blue,
        child: Text('Sticky Header'),
      ),
    ),
    FlexItem(
      height: 1000.size,
      child: Text('Long scrollable content...'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

When scrolling, the header will scroll normally until it reaches the top edge,
then "stick" to that position while the rest of the content scrolls beneath it.

**Sticky Positioning Options:**

- `top`: Sticks to the top edge with specified offset (e.g., `10.position` for
  10px padding)
- `left`: Sticks to the left edge
- `right`: Sticks to the right edge
- `bottom`: Sticks to the bottom edge
- Can combine multiple edges (e.g., `top: 0.position, right: 0.position`)

**Position Type Control:**

FlexibleBox items have a `position` property that controls positioning behavior:

- `PositionType.relative` (default): Item participates in normal flex layout and
  can use sticky positioning with top/left/bottom/right offsets
- `PositionType.none`: Item is removed from flex flow and positioned absolutely
  (equivalent to CSS `position: absolute`)

**Use Cases:**

- Sticky table headers that remain visible while scrolling
- Persistent navigation elements within scrollable sections
- Floating action buttons that stick to container edges
- Sidebar elements that follow scroll until reaching boundaries

#### 9. No Layout Data for Dynamic UI

Flutter's builder widgets (like `LayoutBuilder`) provide basic constraints, but
don't expose detailed layout information needed for advanced dynamic UIs.

**FlexibleBox Solution - Layout Data Builders:**

```dart
FlexBox(
  horizontalOverflow: LayoutOverflow.scroll,
  verticalOverflow: LayoutOverflow.scroll,
  children: [
    FlexItem.builder(
      width: 2000.size,
      height: 2000.size,
      builder: (context, box) {
        // Access comprehensive layout data
        return Container(
          color: box.overflowBounds.left < 0
              ? Colors.red.withOpacity(0.3)
              : Colors.transparent,
          child: Column(
            children: [
              Text('Child Size: ${box.width.toStringAsFixed(0)} x ${box.height.toStringAsFixed(0)}'),
              Text('Child Offset: (${box.offsetX.toStringAsFixed(0)}, ${box.offsetY.toStringAsFixed(0)})'),
              Text('Scroll Position: (${box.scrollX.toStringAsFixed(0)}, ${box.scrollY.toStringAsFixed(0)})'),
              Text('Max Scroll: (${box.maxScrollX.toStringAsFixed(0)}, ${box.maxScrollY.toStringAsFixed(0)})'),
              Text('Viewport: ${box.viewportWidth.toStringAsFixed(0)} x ${box.viewportHeight.toStringAsFixed(0)}'),
              Text('Content: ${box.contentWidth.toStringAsFixed(0)} x ${box.contentHeight.toStringAsFixed(0)}'),
              Text('Overflow Left: ${box.overflowBounds.left.toStringAsFixed(0)}'),
              Text('Overflow Right: ${box.overflowBounds.right.toStringAsFixed(0)}'),
              Text('Overflow Top: ${box.overflowBounds.top.toStringAsFixed(0)}'),
              Text('Overflow Bottom: ${box.overflowBounds.bottom.toStringAsFixed(0)}'),
            ],
          ),
        );
      },
    ),
  ],
)
```

**Available Layout Data (LayoutBox):**

- `size` / `width` / `height`: The child's actual rendered size
- `offset` / `offsetX` / `offsetY`: The child's position relative to the parent
- `scrollX` / `scrollY`: Current scroll offset
- `maxScrollX` / `maxScrollY`: Maximum scrollable distance
- `contentSize` / `contentWidth` / `contentHeight`: Total size of scrollable
  content
- `viewportSize` / `viewportWidth` / `viewportHeight`: Visible viewport size
- `overflowBounds`: How many pixels the child is outside the parent viewport
  - `left`: Pixels overflowing left (negative if visible)
  - `right`: Pixels overflowing right (positive if outside)
  - `top`: Pixels overflowing top (negative if visible)
  - `bottom`: Pixels overflowing bottom (positive if outside)
- `childBounds`: The child's bounding rectangle
- `viewportBounds`: The viewport's bounding rectangle
- `contentBounds`: The content's bounding rectangle (adjusted for scroll)
- `horizontalUserScrollDirection`: Current horizontal scroll direction
- `verticalUserScrollDirection`: Current vertical scroll direction

**Builder Variants:**

- `FlexItem.builder`: Flex item with layout data
- `AbsoluteItem.builder`: Absolutely positioned item with layout data
- `LayoutBoxBuilder`: Access layout data anywhere in the tree

**Use Cases:**

- Highlight elements when they're partially scrolled out of view
- Show/hide UI elements based on scroll position
- Display scroll progress indicators
- Fade in/out content based on visibility
- Implement parallax effects based on scroll offset
- Create interactive scroll-based animations
- Build custom scrollbar indicators
- Implement virtual scrolling optimizations based on overflow data

### When to Use FlexibleBox vs. Flutter Widgets

**Use FlexibleBox when you need:**

- Precise CSS Flexbox behavior for consistency with web layouts
- Complex responsive layouts with viewport-relative sizing
- Multi-line wrapping with sophisticated line alignment
- Absolute or sticky positioning within scrollable containers
- Space distribution algorithms (space-between, space-around, space-evenly)
- Interactive elements that need to overflow parent bounds (dropdowns, tooltips)
- Two-dimensional scrolling (horizontal and vertical simultaneously)
- Large content that overflows in multiple directions (tables, grids, canvases)
- Control over paint order for overlapping elements with shadows or effects
- Sticky headers or footers within scrollable content
- Dynamic UI that adapts based on scroll position or overflow state
- Layout data for scroll-based animations or visibility effects

**Use Flutter's Row/Column when:**

- You need simple, straightforward layouts
- You're using Flutter's standard constraint system throughout your app
- You don't need CSS Flexbox-specific features

## Core Components

### FlexBox

The main flex container widget that implements the flexbox layout algorithm.

```dart
FlexBox(
  direction: FlexDirection.row,               // Layout direction
  wrap: FlexWrap.wrap,                        // Wrapping behavior
  alignItems: BoxAlignmentGeometry.start,     // Cross-axis alignment
  alignContent: BoxAlignmentContent.start,    // Content alignment (for wrapping)
  justifyContent: BoxAlignmentBase.start,     // Main-axis distribution
  rowGap: 8.0.spacing,                        // Spacing between items horizontally
  columnGap: 8.0.spacing,                     // Spacing between items vertically
  children: [                                 // Flex items
    FlexItem(child: Text('Item 1')),
    FlexItem(child: Text('Item 2')),
  ],
)
```

### FlexItem

Configures individual children within a FlexBox.

```dart
FlexItem(
  flexGrow: 1.0,                              // Growth factor
  flexShrink: 0.0,                            // Shrink factor
  width: 200.0.size,                          // Preferred width
  height: 100.0.size,                         // Preferred height
  alignSelf: BoxAlignmentGeometry.start,      // Individual alignment
  paintOrder: 0,                              // Paint order (lower values paint first)
  position: PositionType.relative,            // Positioning context (relative or none)
  top: 10.0.position,                         // Sticky positioning offset (for scrollable containers)
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.blue,
    child: Center(child: Text('Flex Item')),
  ),
)
```

**Key Properties:**

- `flexGrow` / `flexShrink`: Control how the item grows/shrinks to fill space
- `width` / `height`: Preferred size (can use viewport-relative units)
- `minWidth` / `maxWidth` / `minHeight` / `maxHeight`: Size constraints
- `alignSelf`: Override container's `alignItems` for this item
- `paintOrder`: Control the drawing order (lower values paint first/behind)
- `position`: Set to `PositionType.relative` (default) to participate in flex
  layout, or `PositionType.none` to become absolutely positioned
- `top` / `left` / `bottom` / `right`: Used for sticky positioning within
  scrollable containers (when `position` is `relative`)

**Builder Variant:**

`FlexItem.builder` provides access to layout data for building dynamic UI:

```dart
FlexItem.builder(
  width: 200.size,
  height: 100.size,
  builder: (context, box) {
    // Access layout information
    final isScrolledOut = box.overflowBounds.top < -50;
    return Container(
      color: isScrolledOut ? Colors.red : Colors.blue,
      child: Text('Scrolled: ${box.scrollY.toInt()}px'),
    );
  },
)
```

The `LayoutBox` provides comprehensive layout data including scroll position,
overflow bounds, viewport size, content size, and more. See "No Layout Data for
Dynamic UI" section above for details.

### AbsoluteItem

For absolutely positioned children within a FlexBox. These items are removed
from the normal flex flow and positioned relative to the viewport (or nearest
ancestor with `PositionType.relative`).

```dart
AbsoluteItem(
  left: 10.0.position,                         // Left offset from viewport edge
  top: 20.0.position,                          // Top offset from viewport edge
  right: 10.0.position,                        // Right offset from viewport edge
  bottom: 20.0.position,                       // Bottom offset from viewport edge
  width: 100.0.size,                           // Fixed width
  height: 50.0.size,                           // Fixed height
  paintOrder: 10,                              // Paint on top of other elements
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.green,
    child: Center(child: Text('Absolute')),
  ),
)
```

**Key Properties:**

- `left` / `top` / `right` / `bottom`: Position offsets (can use
  `PositionUnit.scrollOffset` for scroll-relative positioning)
- `width` / `height`: Fixed size
- `paintOrder`: Control the drawing order (useful for overlapping elements with
  shadows)

**Builder Variant:**

`AbsoluteItem.builder` provides access to layout data:

```dart
AbsoluteItem.builder(
  right: 20.position,
  bottom: 20.position,
  builder: (context, box) {
    // Show/hide based on scroll position
    final shouldShow = box.scrollY > 100;
    return AnimatedOpacity(
      opacity: shouldShow ? 1.0 : 0.0,
      duration: Duration(milliseconds: 200),
      child: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () {},
        child: Icon(Icons.arrow_upward),
      ),
    );
  },
)
```

### Sticky FlexItem

For sticky positioning within scrollable flex containers, use the `top`, `left`,
`bottom`, and `right` properties on FlexItem. These create sticky elements that
remain fixed relative to the viewport during scrolling. You must also set
`verticalOverflow` or `horizontalOverflow` to `LayoutOverflow.hidden` or
`LayoutOverflow.scroll` on the FlexBox.

```dart
// Wrap FlexBox in a SizedBox to constrain its size and enable scrolling
SizedBox(
  height: 300.0, // Fixed height to enable scrolling
  child: FlexBox(
    direction: FlexDirection.column,
    children: [
      FlexItem(
        height: 100.0.size,
        child: Container(
          color: Colors.blue,
          child: Center(child: Text('Normal Item')),
        ),
      ),
      // Sticky header that sticks to the top
      FlexItem(
        top: 0.0.position,    // Stick to top edge
        left: 0.0.position,   // Stick to left edge
        right: 0.0.position,  // Stick to right edge
        height: 50.0.size,
        child: Container(
          color: Colors.red,
          child: Center(child: Text('Sticky Header')),
        ),
      ),
      FlexItem(
        height: 200.0.size,
        child: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          child: Center(child: Text('Content')),
        ),
      ),
      FlexItem(
        height: 200.0.size,
        child: Container(
          color: Colors.yellow,
          child: Center(child: Text('More Content')),
        ),
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

### Scrollable AbsoluteItem

AbsoluteItem positions elements relative to the viewport bounds, not content
bounds. This means `bottom: PositionUnit.fixed(10.0)` positions the element 10
units from the bottom of the viewport, not the content.

For scroll-aware positioning, use `PositionUnit.scrollOffset` to create elements
that move with scroll:

```dart
// Wrap FlexBox in a SizedBox to make it scrollable
SizedBox(
  height: 400.0, // Fixed height to enable scrolling
  child: FlexBox(
    direction: FlexDirection.column,
    children: [
      // Regular content
      FlexItem(
        height: 200.0.size,
        child: Container(
          color: Colors.blue,
          child: Center(child: Text('Content 1')),
        ),
      ),
      FlexItem(
        height: 200.0.size,
        child: Container(
          color: Colors.green,
          child: Center(child: Text('Content 2')),
        ),
      ),
      FlexItem(
        height: 200.0.size,
        child: Container(
          color: Colors.yellow,
          child: Center(child: Text('Content 3')),
        ),
      ),
      
      // Absolute positioned element that stays fixed in viewport
      AbsoluteItem(
        right: 20.0.position,                 // 20px from right viewport edge
        bottom: 20.0.position,                // 20px from bottom viewport edge
        width: 60.0.size,
        height: 60.0.size,
        child: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {},
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ),
      
      // Element that follows scroll position
      AbsoluteItem(
        left: 10.0.position,
        top: PositionUnit.scrollOffset + 10.0.position, // Moves with scroll
        width: 40.0.size,
        height: 40.0.size,
        child: Container(
          color: Colors.red,
          child: Center(child: Text('Scroll\nIndicator')),
        ),
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

### Scrollbars

The `Scrollbars` widget provides scrollbar UI for scrollable FlexBox containers.
It automatically shows/hides scrollbars based on content overflow and supports
both vertical and horizontal scrolling.

#### Basic Usage

```dart
SizedBox(
  width: 400,
  height: 300,
  child: Scrollbars(
    child: FlexBox(
      direction: FlexDirection.column,
      children: [
        for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++)
          FlexItem(
            height: 80.size,
            child: Container(
              margin: EdgeInsets.all(8),
              color: Colors.primaries[i % Colors.primaries.length],
              child: Center(child: Text('Item $i')),
            ),
          ),
      ],
    ),
  ),
)
```

#### Customizing Scrollbar Appearance

You can customize the scrollbar appearance using `DefaultScrollbar`:

```dart
Scrollbars(

### Convenience Widgets

#### RowBox

Horizontal flex layout (equivalent to `FlexBox(direction: FlexDirection.row)`):

```dart
RowBox(
  alignItems: BoxAlignmentGeometry.center,
  justifyContent: BoxAlignmentBase.spaceBetween,
  rowGap: 8.0.spacing,
  children: [
    FlexItem(child: Text('Left')),
    FlexItem(child: Text('Center')),
    FlexItem(child: Text('Right')),
  ],
)
```

#### ColumnBox

Vertical flex layout (equivalent to `FlexBox(direction: FlexDirection.column)`):

```dart
ColumnBox(
  alignItems: BoxAlignmentGeometry.stretch,
  justifyContent: BoxAlignmentBase.start,
  columnGap: 12.0.spacing,
  children: [
    FlexItem(child: Text('Top')),
    FlexItem(child: Text('Middle')),
    FlexItem(child: Text('Bottom')),
  ],
)
```

## Extension Methods

The package provides convenient extension methods on `int` and `double` for
creating units:

```dart
import 'package:flexiblebox/flexiblebox_extensions.dart';

// Size units
100.size              // SizeUnit.fixed(100.0)
50.0.size             // SizeUnit.fixed(50.0)
0.5.relativeSize      // SizeUnit.viewportSize * 0.5 (50% of viewport)

// Position units
10.position           // PositionUnit.fixed(10.0)
20.0.position         // PositionUnit.fixed(20.0)
0.25.relativePosition // PositionUnit.viewportSize * 0.25 (25% of viewport)

// Spacing units
8.spacing             // SpacingUnit.fixed(8.0)
16.0.spacing          // SpacingUnit.fixed(16.0)
0.1.relativeSpacing   // SpacingUnit.viewportSize * 0.1 (10% of viewport)

// Percentage helper
50.percent            // 0.5 (useful for calculations)
```

These extensions make the code more concise and readable:

```dart
// Without extensions
FlexItem(
  width: SizeUnit.fixed(100.0),
  height: SizeUnit.fixed(50.0),
  child: MyWidget(),
)

// With extensions
FlexItem(
  width: 100.size,
  height: 50.size,
  child: MyWidget(),
)
```

### Widget Extensions

The `WidgetExtension` provides a fluent, chainable API for configuring widget
properties in flexbox layouts. Instead of wrapping widgets in `FlexItem` or
`AbsoluteItem`, you can use extension methods directly on any widget.

```dart
import 'package:flexiblebox/flexiblebox_extensions.dart';

// Fluent API for widget configuration
Container(color: Colors.blue)
  .width(100.size)
  .height(50.size)
  .flexGrow(1)
  .selfAligned(BoxAlignment.center);

// Equivalent to:
FlexItem(
  width: 100.size,
  height: 50.size,
  flexGrow: 1,
  alignSelf: BoxAlignment.center,
  child: Container(color: Colors.blue),
);
```

#### Chaining Example

Extension methods can be chained for a clean, declarative syntax:

```dart
FlexBox(
  direction: FlexDirection.row,
  children: [
    // Fixed-size sidebar
    Container(color: Colors.grey)
      .width(200.size)
      .height(100.percent.relativeSize),
    
    // Flexible content area
    Container(color: Colors.white)
      .flexGrow(1)
      .minWidth(300.size)
      .selfAligned(BoxAlignment.stretch),
    
    // Absolutely positioned overlay
    Icon(Icons.close)
      .asAbsoluteItem
      .positioned(top: 10.position, right: 10.position)
      .paintOrder(100),
  ],
)
```

## Layout Properties

### Math Operations

All unit types (`SizeUnit`, `SpacingUnit`, `PositionUnit`) support mathematical
operations:

```dart
// Basic arithmetic
SizeUnit combinedWidth = 100.size + 50.size;
PositionUnit offset = 200.position - 50.position;
SpacingUnit scaled = 10.spacing * 2.0; // Multiply by scalar

// Complex expressions (equivalent to CSS calc())
SizeUnit halfViewport = SizeUnit.viewportSize * 0.5; // 50% of viewport size
SizeUnit responsiveSize = 100.size + SizeUnit.viewportSize * 0.2; // 100px + 20% viewport
PositionUnit centered = PositionUnit.viewportSize * 0.5 - PositionUnit.childSize * 0.5; // Center child

// Negation
SizeUnit negative = -100.size;

// Constraints
PositionUnit clamped = 150.position.clamp(
  min: 0.position,
  max: 300.position,
);
```
